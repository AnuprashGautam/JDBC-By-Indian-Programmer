# What is the meaning of these three lines?
``` java
FileInputStream(image_path);
byte[] imagedata=new byte[fis.available()];
fis.read(imagedata);
```

----

These three lines of code are used to read an image file from the specified path (`image_path`) and store its data in a byte array (`imagedata`). Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each line:

1. **`FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(image_path);`**
   - This creates a `FileInputStream` object (`fis`) that opens a connection to the file specified by `image_path`. `FileInputStream` is used to read data (in bytes) from files.

2. **`byte[] imagedata = new byte[fis.available()];`**
   - This line creates a byte array (`imagedata`) with a size equal to the number of bytes available in the file. The `fis.available()` method returns the estimated number of bytes that can be read from the file without blocking.

3. **`fis.read(imagedata);`**
   - This reads bytes from the `FileInputStream` (`fis`) into the `imagedata` array. After this line, the byte array (`imagedata`) holds the entire content of the image file, which can then be used for further processing (such as displaying the image or storing it in a database).
